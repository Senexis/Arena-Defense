# Arena Defense
Arena defense is a top-down wave defense game built in Unity v2019.1.4f1 for a school assignment involving serious games. The game involves different in-game classes based off the school's different academies. Most of the in-game lore text is in Dutch, but the main game can still easily be played even if you're not a native Dutch speaker. This game was made by multiple people, including me. The credits can be found below.
